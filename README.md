# VideoCaptioningWithPytorch
A notebook to caption frames of a video every N seconds using PyTorch DenseNet. Works for semi-realtime webcam feed too.

This notebook uses PyTorch Dense Convolutional Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion. DenseNets have several compelling advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, strengthen feature propagation, encourage feature reuse, and substantially reduce the number of parameters.
